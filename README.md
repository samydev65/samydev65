# About Me :computer: :rocket:

Just a guy uploading projects on GitHub :sunglasses: :keyboard: :zap:
Coding, learning, and messing around with ideas :nerd_face: :bulb:
Working on random projects whenever I get the motivation :sleeping: :coffee:
“I will be uploading my projects here, updating them, and building new stuff as I go.” :hammer_and_wrench::sparkles:
-Me probably
I keep my repos organized… most of the time :file_folder: :woozy_face:
Trust the process and commit often :sparkle: :floppy_disk: :pray:
